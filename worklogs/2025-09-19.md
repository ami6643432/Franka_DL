## Tasks
- Integrated the IsaacLab Franka cabinet task into the local project and converted it to use the Direct MARL API while retaining the original single-policy behavior.
- Restored cabinet joint actuators and ensured their observations are available so drawer motion matches the upstream task.
- Updated actuator configs to the new `*_sim` parameters and added MAPPO shared-state buffers to eliminate SKRL runtime warnings.
- Expanded training defaults (2048 envs, longer rollout horizon) and captured new MAPPO runs; documented how to launch training and replay checkpoints.
- Verified gripper control span, aligned reset targets, and confirmed cabinet joints remain dynamically simulated and observable.

## Notes
- Latest MAPPO run directory: `logs/skrl/franka_cabinet_direct_marl/2025-09-19_13-22-28_mappo_torch/` (contains `agent_4800.pt` and `best_agent.pt`).
- Use `python scripts/skrl/play.py --task Custom-Franka-Cabinet-Direct-v0 --algorithm MAPPO --num_envs 1 --checkpoint <path>` to visualize trained agents.
